## Introduction
Deal with archive files that contain files with name in Japanese all the time?
Frequent customer on DLSite or other Japanese sites?

When you tried to extract these archive using 7zip, you got error like below.

After a few hours researching the correct combination of command line options 
and arguments, I finally get 7zip to extract archive files with name in Japanese 
correctly, but it is pain to input those every time.

That's why I created this program.

## Installation
1. Download the archive from [Releases](https://github.com/Miracutor/jpzip/releases).
2. Extract to anywhere you like.
3. (Optional) Set up the PATH pointed to the directory that you extract the archive. This to make sure that jp7zip is 
accessible to anywhere in your system.

## Usage
```
jpzip [-h] [-o OUTPUT | -os] input
```
```
input                 (Required) Input archive.
-h, --help            show this help message and exit
-o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                      Output directory. If not specified, output will be at the same directory as the archive.
-os, --output_same    Output to a new directory with same name with the archive name.
```
### Extract files to an output directory:

```
jpzip <path to input archive> [-o|--output] <path to output directory>
```

### Extract files to the new folder with archive name:
